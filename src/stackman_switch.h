/* raw stack switching function. The caller supplies a callback
 * and context to perform determine the new stack pointer and
 * perform cleanup of old stack and initialization of the new
 * stack.
 * The platform specific implementation of the function is responsible
 * for saving and restoring any machine registers that are assumed
 * to be unchanged across function calls and to change the actual
 * stack pointer.
 *
 * The implementation must simply:
 * 1) store all platform and cpu state on the stack (callee-stored
 *    registers, exception state, etc)
 * 2) call the callback with the context, opcode STACKMAN_OP_SAVE and
 *    the current stack pointer. This allows the application to do additional
 *    cleanup and determine the new stack pointer.
 * 3) replace the stack pointer with the returned value from the callback.
 * 4) call the callback again with opcode STACKMAN_OP_RESTORE and the new
 *    stack pointer. This allows the application to initialize its state
      after the switch.
 * 5) Pop the platform state back from stack.
 * 6) return the result from the second call of the callback.
 *
 * Note that the callback and context are _not_ guaranteed
 * to be stack local.  That is, even if the stack pointer is modified
 * according to the first call to the callback, the same callback and
 * context may be used during the second callback, in the new stack.
 * Therefore, the same callback and context pointers should always be used
 * when switching between stacks.  This
 * restriction could be lifted by pushing both values onto the stack
 * before switching but the added complexity of platform implementations
 * doesn't seem to warrant that for such an exotic use case.
 *
 * an appropriate implementation is included by
 * platforms/platform.h
 * A template implementation is available in
 * platforms/switch_template.h
